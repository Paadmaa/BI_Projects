# Air Quality Index (AQI)

## [Overview](pplx://action/followup)

This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of air quality data, focusing on pollution levels in various cities and trends over time. It allows users to quickly identify highly polluted areas, track AQI trends, and understand the levels of different pollutants.

## [Key Metrics and Visualizations](pplx://action/followup)

The dashboard includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations:

*   **[Average Pollutant Levels](pplx://action/followup):** Displays the average levels of key pollutants:
    *   Avg. of CO: 2.25
    *   Avg. of NO: 17.57
    *   Avg. of SO2: 14.53
    *   Avg. of PM2.5: 67.45
*   **[Top 5 Polluted Cities](pplx://action/followup):** A horizontal bar chart ranking the top 5 cities with the highest pollution levels:
    *   Ahmedabad
    *   Delhi
    *   Lucknow
    *   Patna
    *   Gurugram
*   **[Least Polluted Cities](pplx://action/followup):** A horizontal bar chart showing the least polluted cities:
    *   Coimbatore
    *   Kochi
    *   Ernakulam
    *   Shillong
    *   Aizawl
*   **[Area-wise AQI Overview](pplx://action/followup):** A map visualizing AQI levels across different cities.  The size and color of the circles likely represent the AQI value for each city.  Cities included in the overview are Ahmedabad, Delhi, Patna, Gurugram, Lucknow, Talcher, and Jorapokhar.
*   **[AQI Trend Overview by Year](pplx://action/followup):** A line chart illustrating the AQI trend over the years (2015-2020).
    *   2015: 212.46
    *   2016: 197.15
    *   2017: 181.47

    *   2020: 113.52

### [Filters](pplx://action/followup)

*   A dropdown menu at the top allows filtering the data, but the exact filtering options are not clear from the image ("All" is selected). It could be by pollutant type, region, or other relevant categories.

## [Data Insights](pplx://action/followup)

Based on the dashboard, some key insights include:

*   **[Highly Polluted Cities](pplx://action/followup):** Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Lucknow are among the most polluted cities.
*   **[Least Polluted Cities](pplx://action/followup):** Coimbatore, Kochi, and Ernakulam have relatively lower pollution levels.
*   **[AQI Trend](pplx://action/followup):**  There's a general decreasing trend in AQI from 2015 to 2020, although there's a slight increase from 2017 to 2018.
*   **[Pollutant Levels](pplx://action/followup):** PM2.5 has the highest average value compared to CO, NO, and SO2.
