The current business environment demands data-driven decision-making, but Company X is facing challenges in effectively tracking and visualizing key sales and profitability metrics. 

This has led to missed opportunities in understanding customer behavior, sales performance across categories, and overall profitability trends.

 The lack of clear insights from raw data makes it difficult for the management to take timely and informed actions.

To address these challenges, this Power BI report consolidates critical KPIs, including total orders , quantity sold , total sales , and revenue per customer. Additionally, the report provides detailed breakdowns of sales by category (Electronics, Clothing, Furniture) and payment mode through interactive donut charts. It further highlights top-performing customers, cities, and sub-categories using stack bar charts, while clustered bar charts visualize profit trends by quarter and a clear view of profit/loss margins. A line chart for monthly sales offers a continuous perspective on performance across time.

This comprehensive Power BI dashboard will enable the company to efficiently monitor key business metrics, understand sales trends, and make data-backed decisions to enhance overall business performance.
