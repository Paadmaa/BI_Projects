# Child Mortality Rate Dashboard - README

## [Overview](pplx://action/followup)

This dashboard visualizes child mortality rates (the estimated share of newborns who die before reaching the age of five) from 2000 to 2022. It presents a global overview, continental breakdowns, trends over time, and a spotlight on the top 5 countries with the highest rates.

## [Key Metrics and Visualizations](pplx://action/followup)

The dashboard includes the following key elements:

*   **[Child Mortality Rate](pplx://action/followup):** The overall child mortality rate. In the year 2000, this rate was 3.68%.
*   **[Continental Filters](pplx://action/followup):** Checkboxes to filter the data by continent:
    *   Africa
    *   Asia
    *   Europe
    *   North America
    *   Oceania
    *   South America
*   **[Global Map](pplx://action/followup):** A world map visualizing child mortality rates by country.  Color intensity likely represents the mortality rate, with darker colors indicating higher rates.
*   **[Mortality Trend by Year](pplx://action/followup):** A bar chart showing the child mortality rate trend from 2000 to 2022.  The bars represent the percentage of mortality for each year.
*   **[Top 5 Countries](pplx://action/followup):** A series of line charts displaying the child mortality rate trend for the top 5 countries with the highest rates:
    *   Chad
    *   Niger
    *   Nigeria
    *   Sierra Leone
    *   Somalia

## [Data Insights](pplx://action/followup)

Based on the dashboard, some key insights include:

*   **[Overall Rate](pplx://action/followup):** In 2000, 3.68% of newborns died before reaching the age of five.  The overall goal is to reduce this percentage.
*   **[Trend Over Time](pplx://action/followup):** The bar chart showing "% Mortality by Year" is trending downwards, this indicates that mortality rates have decreased from 2000 to 2022.
*   **[Top Countries](pplx://action/followup):** Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Somalia have some of the highest child mortality rates.
*   **[Continental Differences](pplx://action/followup):** Using the continental filters can reveal which continents have the highest and lowest rates.
*   **[Top Countries Trends](pplx://action/followup):** The line charts for the Top 5 Countries show the trend in child mortality for each of those countries from 2000 to 2020.

## [Potential Use Cases](pplx://action/followup)

*   Track progress in reducing child mortality rates globally and in specific regions.
*   Identify countries and continents where intervention efforts are most needed.
*   Monitor the impact of policies and programs aimed at improving child survival.
*   Raise awareness about child mortality issues.
*   Inform resource allocation decisions for healthcare and development initiatives.
